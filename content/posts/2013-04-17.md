Started work on a new project that a friend brought me into, helping build a site for an upcoming food truck venture.

My first task is to build out the responsive layout for the site. In my learning so far I've read a lot on mobile first design. Its awesome to see those positives in action as I work through this stuff from scratch. Starting small and working bigger really does help you distill your content down to what you actually care to show.
